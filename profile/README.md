# Development of an Interactive Visualization and Training Toolkit for Climate Impacts on the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary 

This is a repository holding all code relating to the development of a training toolkit and the web application for the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary as well as the Climate Datalab use.

## Project summary
Channel Islands Marine Sanctuary (CINMS) comprises 1,470 square miles surrounding Northern Channel Islands: Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, San Miguel, and Santa Barbara islands that protects various species and habitats. However, these sensitive habitats are highly susceptible to climate-driven ‘shock’ events, which are associated with extreme values of temperature, pH, or ocean nutrient levels. A particularly devastating example was seen in 2014-16, when extreme temperatures and changes in nutrient conditions off the California coast led to large-scale die-offs of marine organisms. The objective of this project is to develop an educational toolkit and interactive, Python-based web application to visualize ecologically significant climate variables near the CINMS. The web application will be used by UCSB researchers to analyze ‘large ensembles’ of climate model output, and by CINMS staff to develop new indicators of shocks to marine ecosystems. The educational toolkit, composed of Jupyter notebooks, will be part of the ongoing development of the Climate DataLab training environment.
